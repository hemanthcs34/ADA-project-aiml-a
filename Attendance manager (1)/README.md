Attendance Manager
----------------------

This is a self-developed, standalone web application created to help students easily track their attendance and manage their bunk limits effectively.

Project Developed & Designed By:
Manasa R Patel (https://github.com/ManasaRPatel)

Description:
Attendance Manager allows users to input subject-wise attendance data and visually track how many classes they can afford to miss. It’s a fully self-contained web app built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript — all embedded within a single `index.html` file for ease of portability and deployment.

Key Features:
- Add, view, and manage multiple subjects
- Set total classes and bunk limit per subject
- Real-time calculations for remaining allowable bunks
- Clean, minimal UI with responsive layout
- All-in-one file: no external CSS or JS dependencies

Technology Stack:
- HTML
- CSS 
- JavaScript 

How to Use:
1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Navigate to the folder `Attendance Manager (1)/`.
3. Open the `index.html` file in any web browser.
4. Start entering your subjects and attendance details to begin tracking.

Project Structure:
